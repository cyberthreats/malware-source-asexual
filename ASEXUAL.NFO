읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

  Type : PSRhA  - Parastic & Spawning Resident  - Mutating
  Origin : Virogen's Drunken Programming Inc.
  Length : 1674-1880
  Interrupts Hooked : 21h and critical error handler 24h


  characteristics:
    This virus is a memory resident parastic COM infector and spawning
   EXE infector. It is mutative.. with only 2 bytes remain constant
   in replicated copies, but none in constant relative locations to the start
   of viral code or to each other. It infects up to 5 files in the
   current directory which a program is executed or a new drive is selected.
   It first searches out EXE hosts, and if there are none to be infected,
   it then proceeds to COM infections. All ANTI-VIR.* and CHKLST.* files
   in the current directory are killed before any file is infected.   This
   virus is also kept encrypted in memory to prevent easy detection of it
   there too.     It's code is stored just below the 640k boundary.

  activation:
   This is a non-malicious virus and it's activation is simple.. On the
   2nd of any month, when an infected program is executed it displays :
    "ASeXual virus v0.99 - Your computer has been artificially Phucked!"
   .. while beeping and flashing the keyboard lights as well as attempting
   print screens.

   Do whatever you want with this virus.. but don't take my name off
   the code. .. oh yea.. and don't hold me responsible if you infect
   yourself, or someone else.  It's not my problem.
